this is important!! please read!!
——————————————————————————————————-——-
I am currently experiencing significant stress due to a recurring issue. I often feel depressed and seek comfort by cuddling with individuals with whom I am comfortable, particularly those I trust, rather than with strangers. It is important to note that when I am feeling down, I typically choose to sit beside my closest friends or family members. However, despite my efforts to manage my emotions, I frequently find myself overwhelmed, which has understandably impacted my interactions with others. Regrettably, I have already lost two important friendships as a result of this situation. AND PLEASE FUCKING REMEMBER THAT I CARE FOR OTHERS SO DON'T BE FUCKING AGGRESSIVE TO ME

⎯⎯ ୨ Bipolar ୧ ⎯

I'm really emotional and please don't dump your trauma / issue w me if I'm not in a mood because it upset me alot!! I don't mind if you want to vent just dm my disc it's @ .ashxer0

But if you want to talk about your issues ask me first because I might be in a bad mood!!

-drama / roleplaying players. Sorry but I don't really like roleplaying and dramas because I'm lazy and prefer peace

-Adult theme. Okay seriously, There's kids in public server instead go to 18+ server to talk about adult themes!!

-pp troll skin. The skin is not funny instead it's disgusting !! ( PLEASE BE AWARE THERE ARE KIDS SO IF YOU WANT TO TROLL GO TO 18+ SERVER)

-hh/hb. I only like the characters !! But I don't support the fandom and the creator

Extra info !!

I'm always at sonic area but sometimes I'm at other places with my friend !! Or sometimes I'm alone at other fandoms like phighting. I also crown 👑 people because I love their skins just to be kind <3 !! and also be aware that my grammar may be that bad because I either speak Malay or Spanish since my dad is half Norwegian I can speak it a bit not too much. I just found out I have Dyscuculia known as math dyslexia and I still count with my fingers and others.
