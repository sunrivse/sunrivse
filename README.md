My name is Asher. I’m an 18-year-old woman with a strong interest in various fandoms. I enjoy being part of different communities, discussing characters, stories, and ideas that resonate with me. Talking about the things I care about is something I genuinely enjoy, especially when I find people who share the same passions.

By nature, I’m an introvert. I tend to be quiet and reserved around people I don’t know well. However, once I feel comfortable with someone, my personality shifts — I become much more open, energetic, and expressive. If I act outgoing or hyper around you, it’s because I feel safe enough to be myself.

In my free time, I like to draw. It’s a creative outlet that helps me relax and stay focused, especially when I’m feeling bored or overwhelmed. Sometimes, when I’m really into my drawing, I get deeply absorbed in it and may not respond to messages right away. For example, if I’m on Pony Town and someone whispers to me, I might take a while to reply. It’s never personal — I just appreciate having space to focus, and I hope others can be patient with that.

Overall, I’m someone who takes time to open up, but when I do, I’m honest, engaged, and loyal. I value creativity, comfort, and meaningful connection, and I do my best to bring those things into the way I interact with others.
