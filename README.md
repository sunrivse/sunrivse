I would like to introduce myself; my name is Asher. I prefer to be referred to as "Sunrise."

Please find below my basic guidelines for engagement with others:

1. Individuals under the age of 12 may wish to refrain from initiating contact, as I find interactions with younger individuals can be uncomfortable for me.

The following acronyms represent my preferences regarding interaction:

1. DNIUF - Do Not Interact Unless Friends 
2. DNI - Do Not Interact 
3. DND - Do Not Disturb 
4. AFD - Away From Devices 
5. OFFTAB - Not on Tab 
6. DNIUCF - Do Not Interact Unless Close Friends 
7. W2I - Whisper to Interact 
8. W2C - Whisper to Contact 
9. DNIUP - Do Not Interact Unless at a Party 
10. INT - Interact 

Please note that I tend to be sensitive and may appear reserved; as such, I may not engage in conversation as frequently.

Thank you for understanding my communication preferences.

Best regards,  
Asher (Sunrise)
